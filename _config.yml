          As a student majoring in cybersecurity, I completed a rigorous academic program that provided me with a strong foundation in core concepts of cybersecurity such as network security, cryptography, digital forensics, and vulnerability analysis.

          I have also developed a deep understanding of domestic and international cybersecurity laws and regulations, including Network Act, Personal Information Protection Act, GDPR, and the Tallinn Manual.

          I was challenged to apply my knowledge to real-world cyber threats and security issues by participating in hands-on projects and research opportunities, and I developed my problem-solving and critical thinking skills by collaborating with my peers.
